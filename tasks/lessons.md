# Lessons

Mistakes made and reusable lessons from George's feedback. Append-only; newest at top.

## 2026-07-12 — One control, one meaning; async actions need instant feedback

George flagged the v4 search pill: it displayed the current locality (`📍 Linz`) as its resting
label, so "where you are" masqueraded as "what you searched" — confusing. And locate-me waited up
to 8s for a fresh GPS fix before doing anything visible, with no in-flight indicator and one
generic error toast. **Lesson:** (1) don't overload a control with a second meaning to save space —
search shows search, location shows location; (2) any button that triggers an async fetch must
respond within ~100ms (fly to last-known / show a pulse) and fail loudly with a cause-specific
message (denied vs unavailable), not a generic one after a long silent wait.

## 2026-07-11 — Sentinel values are not data; re-audit consumers when a new data class arrives

Two same-day instances of one class: (1) venue grouping by "coords within 30m" merged 50 unrelated
events because town-centroid *fallback* coords are identical, not near; (2) "null opening_hours =
always open" was fine for hand-added parks but labeled 54 newly mined museums/pools "Immer geöffnet".
**Lesson:** fallback/sentinel encodings (centroid coords, null-as-default, generic venue names like
"Online") silently break when a new data source class lands. When adding a data class, grep every
consumer of the fields it populates and ask "does this code assume precision/meaning the new data
doesn't have?" Related: generic institutional names (Gemeindeamt, Pfarrzentrum…) match across all of
Austria — never accept a POI geocode without a distance bound to the expected town.

## 2026-07-11 — Negative caches outlive the rule that produced them

Geocode sanity bounds were widened (Linz box → OÖ → Austria), but the geocache had stored `hit=false`
rows for towns rejected under the OLD bounds — so Bad Ischl extracted 25 events and published 0,
silently, while everything looked green. **Lesson:** whenever a validation rule feeding a cache
changes (bounds, filters, schemas), purge the cache's *negative* entries in the same change — misses
are cheap to recompute and poisonous to keep. A warning comment now sits on `inRegion()` itself.
Related repeat-offender: `npm run crawl` without `--env-file=.env.local` still fails at runtime
(lesson from 2026-07-10 — it bit again; always launch scripts with the env file).

## 2026-07-10 — Supabase connection strings: pooler host, URL-encoded password, `.env.local`

Wiring the app to Supabase hit three avoidable snags in a row: (1) the **direct** host
`db.<ref>.supabase.co` is IPv6-only and won't resolve in many envs — always use the **transaction
pooler** (`aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:6543`, user `postgres.<ref>`, `prepare:false`).
(2) A DB password with reserved characters **must be percent-encoded** inside `DATABASE_URL`, or
the driver misparses it and tries the *username* as a hostname (`ENOTFOUND postgres.<ref>`).
(3) The env file must be **`.env.local`** (leading dot) — `env.local` is silently ignored by Next,
and plain `node scripts/*.mjs` needs `--env-file=.env.local` (it doesn't auto-load). **Lesson:** when
a user pastes a Supabase URL, verify host≈pooler, port 6543, user `postgres.<ref>`, and a
non-placeholder, encoded password before trying to connect. Reconstruct the pooler form from a
direct string rather than asking for a re-paste.

## 2026-07-10 — Timezone must be pinned to Europe/Vienna, not the host

Stored `starts_at`/`ends_at` are Vienna wall-clock strings. The first cut compared them against
SQLite `datetime('now','localtime')` (host TZ) **and** used a space separator where our strings use
`T` — so expiry both string-compared wrong and drifted on any non-Vienna host. Client date chips used
the browser's local day too. **Lesson:** every "now/today/expiry/date-bucket" computation is
Vienna-pinned — `viennaNow()` in `lib/db.js`, `Intl` with `timeZone:'Europe/Vienna'` client-side.
A code reviewer caught the class; don't reintroduce it.

## 2026-07-10 — Guard `ends_at <= starts_at` on every write path

An overnight event ("22:00–02:00", end time parsed as same-day 02:00) produces an `ends_at` before
`starts_at`, so it expires the instant it's inserted. The seed path guarded it; crawl and the POST
route didn't. **Lesson:** cross-cutting invariants (ends-after-starts, dedup, geocode-fallback) must
be applied on *all* write paths (seed, crawl, API POST) in the same change — grep for the twins.

## 2026-07-10 — Map markers need a full sync, not create-only

Markers were created once and never updated/removed, so a recrawl that moved/renamed/expired an
event left stale pins and stale detail data until a hard reload. **Lesson:** on data reload, sync the
marker set — update moved/renamed pins, remove vanished ones, and point the click handler at fresh
event data (no stale closures).

## 2026-07-10 — SQLite on serverless is read-only + ephemeral

Vercel's project dir is read-only and only `/tmp` is writable (and ephemeral). Opening the bundled DB
read-write there fails (WAL sidecars); writes don't persist. **Lesson:** `resolveDbPath()` copies the
seeded DB to `/tmp` on `process.env.VERCEL`; uploads go to `/tmp`; and the honest framing is "read-only
demo until the Supabase port." Don't promise persistent writes on serverless SQLite.

## 2026-07-10 — Data trust: never fabricate, facts + linkback only

A wrong event on the map destroys trust faster than a missing one, and copying source prose/images
is an EU-database-right problem. **Lesson:** extraction/mining uses `null` for unknowns, skips undated
events, writes our own descriptions, and keeps every `source_url`. This is a hard rule, not a nicety.

## 2026-07-12 — `rm -rf .next` under a running dev server / build gives fake errors

Ran `rm -rf .next && npm run build` while the preview dev server (`next dev`) shared the same
`.next`. Result: a misleading `next build` prerender crash (`Cannot read properties of undefined
(reading 'call')`) and, on the dev server, `Cannot find module './331.js'` + missing
`routes-manifest.json` / `middleware-manifest.json` 500s. None were code bugs. **Lesson:** that class
of webpack-runtime error usually means a corrupt/half-written `.next`, not your diff. Don't delete
`.next` while `next dev`/`next build` is touching it. To confirm the code is fine: stop the dev
server, `rm -rf .next`, and do one clean `npm run build`. Only bisect the diff if the *clean* build fails.

## 2026-07-12 — `map.once('load', …)` is not a safe fallback for reactive map updates

The result-cluster source effect gated every update on `map.isStyleLoaded()` and, when false,
deferred to `map.once('load', install)`. But MapLibre's `load` fires exactly once per map, and
`isStyleLoaded()` briefly returns false whenever a source is reloading (e.g. right after a
`setData`). So a `setData` that landed during a reload — as happens when searching a location
re-anchors the radius and refilters — was dropped and never reapplied, leaving the map empty until
an unrelated re-render happened to run the effect while the style was loaded ("click something and
it appears"). **Lesson:** once a source exists, `setData` is always safe regardless of
`isStyleLoaded()` — call it directly and return. Reserve the style-loaded gate (and the one-shot
`once('load')`) for the *initial* `addSource`/`addLayer` only, never for subsequent data updates.
